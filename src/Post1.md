## Basics of Markdown
Markdown is the most popular markup language that can be used to format documents. It can be used to create *websites*,*ebooks*,*email*,*chats in discussions forums*.

### Topics
1. #### Paragraphs 

    MD expects a full line space to show texts in a different line else it joins text in the same line.

2. #### Text decorations

    MD can write **bold** texts, ~~italic~~ *italic*  texts

3. #### Headings
    
    No of #'s represent the type of heading. Github will automatically add id's to headings, so the text will be automatically linked. 
    ## This is heading 2
    ### This is heading 3

4. #### Links
